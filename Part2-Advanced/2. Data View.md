# What is Dataview?
Do you like SQL? 
Do you wish you could Query your notes? 
Welcome to **data view**!!

**DataView** is a powerful community plugin that allows you to query, display, and visualize data within your notes. It's essentially a way to turn your notes into a dynamic database. The plugin lets you run custom queries on your notes based on metadata like tags, links, and creation dates



```dataview
TABLE title, status, due, priority
FROM ""
WHERE category = "Tasks"
SORT due ASC
```

```dataview
TABLE title, author, rating, date_finished
FROM ""
WHERE category = "Books" AND finished = true
SORT date_finished DESC
```

```dataview
TABLE title, date, attendees, summary
FROM ""
WHERE category = "Meetings" AND date >= date(2025-02-01)
SORT date ASC
```
