# SchemaGuardian: DevOps Deployment Guide
#schemaguardian
[[Sprint Planning Notes]]


This guide provides a step-by-step approach for deploying SchemaGuardian in a production environment. It includes infrastructure setup, deployment strategies, environment configurations, and monitoring best practices.

SchemaGuardian follows a **containerized, microservice-based architecture**, making it easy to deploy across different environments, whether on-premises or cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, or Azure. Its deployment model is similar to **Liquibase for schema migrations** and **DataHub for metadata tracking**, but it focuses specifically on automated schema validation.

---
## **Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following installed before deployment:

- **Docker** & **Docker Compose** (for containerization)
- **Terraform** (for infrastructure automation)
- **Kubernetes (kubectl + Helm)** (if using K8s)
- **AWS CLI** (if deploying on AWS)
- **PostgreSQL/MySQL** (for metadata storage)
- **Kafka** (for event-driven schema changes, optional)

---

## **1. Standalone Deployment (Basic VM Setup)**

For local or minimal deployment, you can install and run SchemaGuardian directly on a server.

### **Install Dependencies**

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3-pip postgresql-client
pip3 install schema-guardian

```

```bash
schema-guardian --config /etc/schema_guardian/config.yaml

```

This will run SchemaGuardian as a simple daemon process. However, this is **not recommended for production** due to lack of scalability and fault tolerance.

---

## **2. Docker Deployment (Recommended for Small Teams)**

To deploy SchemaGuardian using Docker, follow these steps:

### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fakeorg/schema-guardian.git  
cd schema-guardian
```
### **Step 2: Configure Environment Variables**

Create a `.env` file to define the database connection and alerting services:
```ini
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@db:5432/schema_guardian
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXX

```

### Step 3: Deploy with Docker Compose
```
docker-compose up -d
```

This starts the following services:

- `schema-guardian-api` (Schema validation service)
- `schema-guardian-worker` (Background change processing)
- `postgres` (Metadata storage)

## **3. Kubernetes Deployment (For Large-Scale Production)**

For cloud deployments, SchemaGuardian can run as a set of Kubernetes microservices.

### **Step 1: Apply Kubernetes Configurations**

Modify the `k8s/deployment.yaml` file to match your infrastructure needs, then deploy using:
```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/
```

### **Step 2: Expose the Service**

If running on AWS, expose the service with an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**:
```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: schema-guardian-ingress
spec:
  rules:
    - host: schema-guardian.example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: schema-guardian
                port:
                  number: 80
```

apply changes:
```
kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml
```

### Step 3: Monitor the Deployment

```bash
kubectl get pods -n schema-guardian kubectl logs -f deployment/schema-guardian-api
```

## **4. AWS Serverless Deployment (Lambda & Fargate)**

For organizations using **serverless architectures**, SchemaGuardian can be triggered by events and executed in AWS Lambda.

### **Step 1: Deploy Using Terraform**

Create an S3 bucket for Lambda deployment:

```bash
aws s3 mb s3://schema-guardian-lambda
cd terraform  
terraform init  
terraform apply -auto-approve  
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/schema-guardian --follow

```

## **Environment Configuration**

SchemaGuardian supports multiple environments (dev, staging, production). Each environment should have its own database and validation rules.

|Environment|Database|Alerting|
|---|---|---|
|**Development**|Local PostgreSQL|Console logs only|
|**Staging**|Managed RDS|Slack alerts|
|**Production**|Amazon Aurora|PagerDuty + SNS|

To configure environments, set the `SCHEMA_GUARDIAN_ENV` variable:
```bash
export SCHEMA_GUARDIAN_ENV=production
curl http://localhost:9090/metrics
```

### **Set Up Logging**

Logs are sent to a centralized logging system such as **AWS CloudWatch**, **Elastic Stack**, or **Datadog**.

Example Fluentd configuration for Elasticsearch:### **Set Up Logging**

Logs are sent to a centralized logging system such as **AWS CloudWatch**, **Elastic Stack**, or **Datadog**.

Example Fluentd configuration for Elasticsearch:

```
<match schema_guardian>
  @type elasticsearch
  host es-cluster.local
  port 9200
</match>

```

## **Final Checklist Before Deployment** 

✔ Ensure database migrations are tested in staging.  
✔ Verify Prometheus and Grafana monitoring is active.  
✔ Set up proper logging to detect schema change errors.  
✔ Configure alerting to notify stakeholders of critical changes.  
✔ Run a dry-run validation using:
