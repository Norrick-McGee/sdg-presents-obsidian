## Introduction

Obsidian is a powerful knowledge management tool that leverages Markdown files and bi-directional linking to create a dynamic and interconnected system of notes. The ability to link between notes is what sets Obsidian apart, turning a collection of documents into a personal knowledge graph.

Obsidian is often referred to people as a "Second Brain", which I originally thought was a little silly. 

After a year of use my thoughts are:
It's actually my first brain! 


What makes obsidian such a good brain alternative? 
The aforementioned graph mode! Let's check that out real quick!

Another powerful feature is the ability to query your notes like a database with results that look like this:
```dataview
TABLE title, status, due, priority
FROM ""
WHERE category = "Tasks"
SORT due ASC
```



Here are some cool graphs I found on the internet:
