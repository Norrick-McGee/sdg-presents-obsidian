## Introduction

Obsidian is a powerful knowledge management tool that leverages Markdown files and bi-directional linking to create a dynamic and interconnected system of notes. The ability to link between notes is what sets Obsidian apart, turning a collection of documents into a personal knowledge graph.

## Types of Linking in Obsidian

### 1. **Internal Links**

Internal links connect different notes within your Obsidian vault, allowing you to seamlessly navigate between related topics.

#### Syntax:

```
[[Note Title]]
[[Note Title#Section]] (Linking to a specific section)
[[Note Title|Custom Text]] (Displaying a custom label)
```
[[1.Markdown]]
[[1.Markdown#Key Features]]
[[1.Markdown#Key Features|Markdown Key Features]]

### 2. **Backlinks**

Backlinks show all notes that reference the current note, creating a web of interconnected ideas.
- Found in the right sidebar under the "Backlinks" pane.
- Can also be shown at the bottom of the document (My personal preference)
- Helps discover relationships between notes.

### 3. **Graph View**
Graph View is a visual representation of your linked notes, showing how different concepts interconnect.
- **Global Graph:** Shows all linked notes in your vault.

### 4. **Tags vs. Links**

**Tags (**`**#tag**`**)**: Powerful tool for categorization and quick filtering. #tagsAreCool 

You can check all docs with the same tags simply by searching for the tag, or clicking on the existing tag
